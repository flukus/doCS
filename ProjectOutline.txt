Why?

Most/all current documentation engines are document generators, a once off generation process that generates HTML/CHM files. doCS intends to be a Documentation Server, a dynamic central 
(to the organisation) website where documentation will be provided.

doCS is intended to address the following flaws with current documentation generators:

Speed:

Generting documentation can be fairly time consuming and is usually part of a CI long running CI build. While speed isn't important for integration builds it is still a "nice to have"
feature. This long turn around time can make producing good documentation more time consuming than it should be which usually results in less being written in the first place.

Allot of this speed is lost in generating pages which may or may not ever be read. Because doCS is dynamic this speed penalty is defered until read time.


Visibility:

Most organisations have a central place where documentation is published after it is generated but this is often little known and under utlised. doCS intends to be a 
"third pillar" of developement servers (along with a CI Server and SCM Server) where documenation from all projects will be shared. It is hoped that this will increase visibiliy and
, in turn, quality and quantity of documentation.


Dynamic:

Just as dynamic website are far more capable than static ones we hope that serving documentation dynamicly will open up far more doors for USEFULL representation and quick access.
